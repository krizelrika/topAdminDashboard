    * White background, rounded corners, and subtle shadow.
- Announcements section with stacked cards.
- Trending section showing user handles, avatars, and project names.

## Tech Stack/Technologies
- HTML5 for semantic structure.
- CSS3 (Grid + Flexbox) for layout and styling.
- Google Fonts (Roboto) for typography.
- Material Design Icons for navigation and card icons.

## Development Tips
- Use background colors or borders on grid containers to visualize layout while building.
- Adjust grid track sizes using fr units and px for flexibility.
- This project does not need to be responsive, but you can experiment with  resizing project cards for extra practice.
- Customize fonts, icons, or color scheme to make it your own.

## Possible Future Enhancements
- Add JavaScript for interactive features (collapsible sidebar, dark mode, etc.).
- Make the layout responsive for tablets and mobile.
- Add more animations/hover states for cards and buttons.
